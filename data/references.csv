Journal Article,"Nadini M,Alessandretti L,Di Giacinto F,Martino M,Aiello LM,Baronchelli A","Mapping the NFT revolution: market trends, trade networks, and visual features",Scientific Reports,2021,11,,10 2021,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00053-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00053-8,10.1038/s41598-021-00053-8,"Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts."
Journal Article,"Ghosh I,Alfaro-Corts E,Gmez M,Garca N",Prediction and interpretation of daily NFT and DeFi prices dynamics: Inspection through ensemble machine learning & XAI,International Review of Financial Analysis,2023,,102558,02 2023,2023/2/5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2023.102558,10.1016/j.irfa.2023.102558,"Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) assets have seen a growing media coverage and garnered considerable investor traction despite being classified as a niche in the digital financial sector. The lack of substantial research to demystify the dynamics of NFT and DeFi coins motivates the scrupulous analysis of the said sector. This work aims to critically delve into the evolutionary pattern of the NFTs and DeFis for performing predictive analytics of the same during the COVID-19 regime. The multivariate framework comprises the systematic inclusion of explanatory features embodying technical indicators, key macroeconomic indicators, and constructs linked to media hype and sentiment pertinent to the pandemic, nonlinear feature engineering, and ensemble machine learning. Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) techniques are conjugated with Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) and Random Forest (RF) for enabling the predictive analysis. The predictive performance rationalizes the frameworks' capacity to accurately predict the prices of the majority of the NFT and DeFi coins during the ongoing financial distress period. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies are used to comprehend the nature of the impact of the explanatory variables. Findings suggest that the daily movement of the NFTs and DeFi highly depends on their past historical movement."
Journal Article,Kireyev P,NFT Marketplace Design and Market Intelligence,SSRN Electronic Journal,2022,,,2022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4002303,10.2139/ssrn.4002303,"Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have exploded in popularity in 2021, generating billions of dollars in transaction volume. In tandem, market intelligence platforms have emerged to track summary statistics about pricing and sales activity across different NFT collections. We demonstrate that marketplace design can significantly influence market intelligence, focusing specifically on the costs of bidding which can differ across marketplaces depending on transaction fees, the prevalence of bidding bots, or the user interface for placing bids. We use data from the CryptoPunks marketplace and build an empirical model of the strategic interaction between sellers and bidders. Counterfactual simulations show that a reduction in bidding costs does not change the quantity of sales, but increases the share of sales that result from bids. Listing prices increase as sellers expect to accept more bids, making assets appear more valuable. The listing and realized sale price ratios between rare and common assets shrink, making the market appear more homogeneous. Collections that are offered by two different marketplaces can exhibit significantly different market statistics because of differences in bidding costs rather than differences in inherent value. The results have implications for the interpretation of NFT market intelligence."
Journal Article,"Chen Z,Guo D,Lin Y",A Deep Gaussian Process-Based Flight Trajectory Prediction Approach and Its Application on Conflict Detection,Algorithms,2020,13,293,11 2020,2021/9/17,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a13110293,10.3390/a13110293,"in this work, a deep Gaussian process (DGP) based framework is proposed to improve the accuracy of predicting flight trajectory in air traffic research, which is further applied to implement a probabilistic conflict detection algorithm. The Gaussian distribution is applied to serve as the probabilistic representation for illustrating the transition patterns of the flight trajectory, based on which a stochastic process is generated to build the temporal correlations among flight positions, i.e., Gaussian process (GP). Furthermore, to deal with the flight maneuverability of performing controller¡¯s instructions, a hierarchical neural network architecture is proposed to improve the modeling representation for nonlinear features. Thanks to the intrinsic mechanism of the GP regression, the DGP model has the ability of predicting both the deterministic nominal flight trajectory (NFT) and its confidence interval (CI), denoting by the mean and standard deviation of the prediction sequence, respectively. The CI subjects to a Gaussian distribution, which lays the data foundation of the probabilistic conflict detection. Experimental results on real data show that the proposed trajectory prediction approach achieves higher prediction accuracy compared to other baselines. Moreover, the conflict detection approach is also validated by a obtaining lower false alarm and more prewarning time."

We use wavelet-based decomposition series to establish a multiscale causality-in-quantiles test and a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to reveal the complicated relationships involving crude oil, EPU and stock returns. Our empirical results are as follows:?First, the predictability of crude oil and EPU on industry stock returns is significantly strong under extreme market conditions.?Second, the explanatory ability of EPU on industry stock returns in the long term is stronger than EPU¡¯s ability to explain short term returns.?Third, the impacts of crude oil and EPU on industry stock returns remain remarkably asymmetric across quantile levels.?Finally, nonenergy-intensive industries are also affected by crude oil shocks, but less than energy-intensive industries.?Overall, these empirical findings can provide implications for policymakers to stabilize stock markets and investors to hedge the potential risks from crude oil and EPU."
Journal Article,"Yousaf I,Yarovaya L","Static and dynamic connectedness between NFTs, Defi and other assets: Portfolio implication",Global Finance Journal,2022,53,100719,08 2022,2022/5/1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfj.2022.100719,10.1016/j.gfj.2022.100719,"The paper examines the return and volatility transmission between NFTs, Defi assets, and other assets (oil, gold,?Bitcoin, and S&P 500) using the TVP-VAR framework. The results report weak static return and volatility?spillovers?between NFTs and Defi assets and selected markets, showing that these new digital assets are still relatively decoupled from traditional asset classes. Bitcoin, oil, and half of the NFTs and Defi assets are net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers, whereas rest of the markets are net recipients of spillovers. Our findings show that the dynamic return and volatility connectedness become higher during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and the?cryptocurrency?bubble of 2021. We also compute the static and dynamic optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness for the portfolios of NFTs/other asset and Defi asset/other asset and show that investors and portfolio managers should consider adding NFTs and Defi assets in their portfolios of gold, oil, and stock markets to achieve diversification benefits."

Results from both techniques show significant evidence of dependence between NFT return and volume. Dependence between volume and return is weakest in the Cryptopunks market. Similarly,?quantile regression?results show that during extreme market conditions, equity and gold markets uncertainty, business condition and term-spread are important predictors of Cryptokitties returns, while oil, equity and gold markets uncertainty and?geopolitical risks?significantly predict Cryptopunks and Decentraland markets returns. In all cases, increase in?Bitcoin?prices reduces NFT market returns."
Journal Article,"Ko H,Son B,Lee Y,Jang H,Lee J",The economic value of NFT: Evidence from a portfolio analysis using mean¨Cvariance framework,Finance Research Letters,2022,47,102784,06 2022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2022.102784,10.1016/j.frl.2022.102784,"We investigate whether the inclusion of NFTs in portfolio investing in traditional assets provides a significant diversification benefit for constructing a well-diversified portfolio. We examine Pearson¡¯s correlation, the Gerber Statistic for co-movement, and the spillover index for volatility transmission. Our findings suggest that NFTs are distinct from traditional assets, potentially resulting in portfolio diversification. Using the mean¨Cvariance approach, empirical results demonstrate there exist a statistically significant evidence that the inclusion of NFTs improves the performance of equally weighted and tangency portfolio strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio. It confirms that NFTs have a diversification effect on the traditional asset-based portfolios."
